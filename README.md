## Introduction

The multiphase Lattice Boltzmann simulation provides a numerical approach for simulating fluid dynamics, especially for complex multiphase flows. By utilizing OpenMP for parallelization, the computational efficiency is significantly improved.

## Features

- Simulates multiphase fluid dynamics
- Parallelized using OpenMP for enhanced performance
- Generates visual outputs compatible with Gnuplot

## Requirements

- C++ Compiler (g++)
- OpenMP library
- Gnuplot

## Installation

To compile and run the simulation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/juan3ltran/Multiphase-LB.git
    cd Multiphase-LB
    ```

2. Compile the simulation using the provided Makefile:
    ```bash
    make
    ```

## Usage

To run the simulation and generate the output for Gnuplot, use the following commands:

1. Execute the compiled program:
    ```bash
    ./Multiphase | gnuplot
    ```

This will run the simulation and pipe the output directly to Gnuplot for rendering the results.
